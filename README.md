# Unveiling Global Economic Resilience: A Comparative Visualization of COVID-19's Impact on G20 Nations

## Overview

This project analyzes the differential impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on key economic indicators across G20 nations.  The goal is to create an interactive dashboard visualizing this data, providing insights into economic resilience and identifying potential investment opportunities.  The analysis focuses on comparing various economic indicators (details to be added in future updates) across the G20 countries, highlighting trends and disparities in their recovery trajectories.  This project aims to offer a clear and concise visual representation of complex economic data, making it accessible to investors and researchers alike.


## Technologies Used

* Python 3.x
* Pandas
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* [Add other libraries as needed, e.g., Plotly for interactive dashboards]


## How to Run

1. **Install Dependencies:**  Navigate to the project directory in your terminal and install the required Python packages using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Run the Script:** Execute the main script using:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

   This will generate the visualizations and print a summary of the analysis to the console.


## Example Output

The script will produce:

* **Console Output:** A summary of key findings from the analysis, including comparisons of economic indicators across G20 nations.  Specific metrics and their interpretations will be detailed in the console output.

* **Visualization Files:**  [Specify the types and names of generated files, e.g.,  `gdp_growth.png`, `unemployment_rates.png`,  `interactive_dashboard.html` (if using Plotly or similar)]. These files will contain the visual representations of the economic data, enabling a comparative analysis of the G20 nations' performance during and after the pandemic.
